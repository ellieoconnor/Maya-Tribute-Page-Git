                <h3>About Maya</h3>
                <p>Maya Angelou was born Marguerite Annie Johnson on 4 April, 1928 in St. Louis, Missouri. She grew up
                    in St. Louis and Stamps, Arkansas. Angelou was an American poet, memorist, and civil rights activist (amoung
                    many other accomplishments). She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of 
                    poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She has 
                    received dozens of awards and more than 50 honourary degrees. Angelou is best known for her series of seven 
                    autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, <span class="italics">
                    I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</span> (1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international 
                    recognition and acclaim.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In 1959, at the request of <span class="bold">Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</span>, Angelou became the Northern coordinator 
                    for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. From 1961 to 1962, she was associate editor of <span class="italics">The 
                    Arab Observer</span> in Cairo, Egypt. It was the only English-language weekly news in the Middle East. From 
                    1964 to 1966 she was feature editor of the <span class="italics">The African Review</span> in Accra, Ghana. She returned to 
                    the United States in 1974 and was appointed by <span class="bold">Gerald Ford</span> to the Bicentennial Commission and later 
                    by <span class="bold">Jimmy Carter</span> to the Commission for International Women of the Year. In 1982, Angelou accepted a 
                    lifetime appointment as Reynold's Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North 
                    Carolina. In 1993, she wrote and delivered a poem, <span class="italics">On the Pulse of Morning</span>, at the inauguration 
                    for <span class="bold">President Bill Clinton</span>. In 2000, she received the National Medal of Arts, and in 2010 she was awarded the 
                    Presidential Medal of Freedom by <span class="bold">President Barack Obama</span>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Maya Angelou was the first black woman director in Hollywood. Angelou wrote, produced, and starred in productions 
                    for stage, film, and television. In 1971, she wrote the original screenplay and musical score for the film 
                    <span class="italics">Georgia, Georgia</span>. Angelou was both author and executiv of a five-part television mini-series 
                    <span class="italics">Three Way Choice</span>. She also wrote and produced several prize-winning documentaries, including 
                    <span class="italics">Afro-Americans in the Arts</span> - a PBS special for which received the Golden Eagle Award. Angelou was nominated 
                    twice for a Tony Award for acting: once for her Broadway debut in <span class="italics">Look Away</span> (1973), and again for her 
                    performance in <span class="italics">Roots</span> (1977).
                </p>
                <br>
