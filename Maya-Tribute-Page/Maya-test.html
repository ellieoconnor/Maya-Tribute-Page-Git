        <h3>About Maya Angelou</h3>
        <p>Maya Angelou born Marguerite Annie Johnson in St. Louis, 
            Missouri, on 4 April, 1928. She grew up in St. Louis and in 
            Stamps, Arkansas. Angelou was an American poet, memorist, and 
            civil rights activist (among many other accomplishments). She 
            published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several
            books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies,
            and television shows spanning over 50 years. She has recieved 
            dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. Angelou is 
            best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus
            on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, <em>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</em> 
            (1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international recognition and acclaim.
            <br><br>
            In 1959, at the request of <strong>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</strong>, 
            Angelou became the northern coordinator for the Southern Christian 
            Leadership Conference. From 1961 to 1962, she was associate editor 
            of <em>The Arab Observer</em> in Cairo, Egypt, the only English-
            language news weekly in the Middle East. From 1964 to 1966 she 
            was feature editor of the <em>African Review</em> in Accra, Ghana.
            She returned to the United States in 1974 and was appointed by 
            <strong>Gerald Ford</strong> to the Bicentennial Commission and 
            later by <strong>Jimmy Carter</strong> to the Commission for
            International Women of the Year. She accepted a lifetime 
            appointment in 1982 as Reynolds Professor of American Studies at 
            Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In 1993, 
            Angelou wrote and delivered a poem, "On The Pulse of the Morning," 
            at the inauguration for President Bill Clinton at her request. 
            In 2000, she received the National Medal of Arts, and in 2010 she
            was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by <strong>President Barack Obama</strong>.
            <br><br>
            The first black woman director in Hollywood, Angelou wrote,
            produced, and starred in productions for stage, film, and television. 
            In 1971, she wrote the original screenplay and musical score for the 
            film <em>Georgia, Georgia</em>, and was both author and executive 
            of a five-part television miniseries <em>"Three Way Choice"</em>. 
            She also wrote and produced several prize-winning documentaries, 
            including <em>"Afro-Americans in the Arts,"</em> a PBS special
            for which she received the Golden Eagle Award. Angelou was twice 
            for a Tony award for acting: once for her Broadway debut in 
            <em>Look Away</em> (1973), and again for her performance in <em>Roots</em> 
            (1977).<br><br>
            Angelou died on 28 May, 2014, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
